    "# Linear combination of a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Any vector when we are defining, it depends on which \"basis vectors\" we are choosing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example in general, if  $\\vec{v} = 3\\hat{i}+2\\hat{j}$ then here $\\vec{v}$ is the ***linear combination*** of the two basis vectors $\\hat{i} , \\hat{j}$ which are the unit vectors in ***x-axis*** and ***y-axis*** respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Linear combination of two vectors:-***\n",
    "\n",
    "If any vector is defined as ***adding and scaling of two different vectors*** then that is called the linear combination of two vectors.\n",
    "Let any vector $\\vec{z} = a\\vec{v}+b\\vec{w}$, here $\\vec{z}$ is the vector which is 'addition' of ***a*** times scaling of $\\vec{v}$ and ***b*** times scaling of $\\vec{w}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Possibilities on Linear combination of two vectors:-\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In general all points of the plane can be reached on combination of the two vectors.\n",
    "2. if the two vectors are linear then only points on combination get limited on to the line.\n",
    "3. If the two vectors are zero vectors then only origin can be reached on linear combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Span\n",
    "Span - entire space that can be reached by linear combination of the vectors. The same span can be formed by DIFFERENT sets of vectors - they will span the same space, but we will use different coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{span}(\\{v_1, ..., v_n\\}) = \\{\\alpha_1 v_1 + ... \\alpha_n v_n, \\alpha_i \\in \\mathbb{R} \\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "***Example:***  \n",

    "$v$ is in the span of S, because we can get exactly this vector by taking 5/6 of the first vector of S and 1/6 of the second. \n",

    "## Linear Independence\n",
    "Formal defintion:  \n",
    "The vectors are linearly dependent if there is a linear combination, such that:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\lambda_1 v_1 + \\lambda_2 v_2 + ... + \\lambda_n v_n = 0, \\lambda_i \\in \\mathbb{R}, \\exists \\lambda_i \\neq 0$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "(i.e. excluding the case when all lambdas are zero - trivial solution). \n",
    "\n",
    "**A set of M vectros is independent if each vector points in a geometric dimension not reachable using other vectors in the set.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "More informally: vectors are linearly dependent if one or more vectors can be expressed using other vectors. \n",
    "**Checking for linear independence:** \n",
    "- Step 1: Count vectors and comper with $\\mathbb{R}^N$ (>N -> dependent) \n",
    "- Step 2: Check for 0s in corresponding dimensions. Also, if 0 vector is in the set -> dependent\n",
    "- Educated guess and test (try to get a linear combination)  \n",
    "- Matrix rank method \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Examples: \n",

    "1) $\\{ \\omega_1, \\omega_2 \\} = \\Big\\{ \\begin{bmatrix}\n",

    "2\\\\\n",
    "4\\\\\n",
    "6\\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}  \\Big\\}$ - linearly dependent, because $\\omega_2 = 2 \\omega_1$  \n",

    "3\\\\\n",
    "1\\\\\n",
    "8\\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix} \\Big\\}$ - linearly dependent, because $v_2=7 v_1 - 9 v_3$\n",

    "\n",
    "## Basis vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of vectors can form a **basis** for some subspace if that set spans that subspace and if it contains linearly independent vectors. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Important:**  \n",
    "We ***CAN'T*** have *extra* vectors in the basis because that we'll more than one way to identify a vector in that span. However, if don't have *redundant* vectors, we can uniquely identify a vector. \n",
    "There are $\\infty$ number of bases but they all must contain only linearly independent vectors."
